Renux cross toolchain is a cross toolchain targeting the ARM architecture and have been tested and used on the Texas Instruments OMAP3 platforms.

This script can be run from any Linux based desktop by a Debian/Ubuntu based distribution is recommended since the setup script can install required by packagse. If you have different distro you may have to install some packages yourself, but it should not be a big problem.

The script downloads, configures and compiles all source code for you. The basic idea is that you start the script, wait, and then have you toolchain ready. 

All you have to do to build and install the toolchain is to run:
./createCrossToolchain.bash
